# CryoBase

CryoBase is an application to manage cryo-EM data in the cloud with Amazon Web Service (AWS) Simple Storage Solution (S3). The goal is to provide a convenient way to use low-cost cloud storage to store cryo-EM datasets. The application has an interface for entering metadata for a cryo-EM dataset and uploading the dataset to S3. There is also an interface for browsing and downloading datasets stored on S3. CryoBase is designed to interact with the user's own AWS account so the user has complete control over the data and can access it even without CryoBase.
